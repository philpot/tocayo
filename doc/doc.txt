IMPLEMENTED NAME SEARCH PARAMETERS

GENDER = M and/or F
ORIGIN = EN, FR, etc. mostly languages but some groups including
  Slavic, Scandinavian, African, African-American, American Indian (32
  in all)
SYLLABLES = 1 to 5
STRESS PATTERN = e.g., 10 (stressed,unstressed) Patrick
	               01 (unstressed,stressed) Denise
		       1 (stressed) Ruth
		       0010 (u,u,s,u) Alexander, etc.
DECILE (popularity) = 1 to 10: 10 means most popular 10% of name base
  1 is least popular.  Computed for US SSA data 2000.  Also have raw
  populations but not queryable.
BEGINS/ENDS/CONTAINS LETTER: does/does not have that letter is
  specified position
BEGINS/ENDS/CONTAINS SOUND: does/does not have the phoneme in
  specified position.  Uses CMU pron. EN phonemicization (40 phonemes,
  e.g., Bonaventure is rendered /B AA N AH V EH N CH ER/
SEMANTIC-DISTANCE: each name is associated with meaning(s), e.g.,
  Susan: lily; Tamara: date palm tree; Herbert: bright/ruler/army
  Constructed tree of meanings, so lily<<flower<<plant<<living thing.
  SEMDIST = minimum distance up to fork and then back down. e.g., 
  dist(Susan,Tamara) = flower,plant,living,tree,palm = 4.  All names
  associated with a given root are grouped together as well (Susan,
  Suzanne, Susannah, Shoshana).  There are 1200 different meanings,
  and 1300 different 'family' groupings (because, e.g, two otherwise
  unrelated name families such as 'Luke' and 'Helen' can both mean
  'light').
PHONETIC-DISTANCE: perform EDIT-DISTANCE on two phonemic strings,
  counting the number operations needed to transform p1 into p2.
  e.g., SAMMY /s ae m iy/ to AMY /ey m iy/ is 1*delete+1*subst = 2
  also have more sophisticated subst. cost models; for example,
  substituting IY (as in 'see') and IH (as in 'sit') seems less
  drastic than substituting IY with something like R or Z or OW.

CORPUS

4000 names, approximately 2000 each for M/F.  Names are mostly from US
SSA (incl. popularity), also some from babynames.com.  Origin,
Definitions are from babynames.com with regularization and tree
structure by AGP.  I generated syllables, stress, by hand.  I used USC
ISI code to generate phonetic representations (machine learning based
on pronouncing dictionary), then chose best by hand (plus significant
hand editing).

EXAMPLE:

LUX(39): (namesearch "" :begins-letter '("P" "B" "T" "R" "W" "M")
		     :origin '("G1" "LA" "HE" "EN" "DE")
		     :decile '(3 . 7) :syllables 3 :gender "F"
		     :!ends-sound "AH")

=>

"SELECT distinct n.name,n.gender,n.origin,n.syllables,n.stresspat,
p.pron,s.sem
FROM name n,pron p,sem s
WHERE n.name = p.name
AND s.name = n.name
AND (n.origin = 'DE' OR n.origin = 'EN' OR n.origin = 'HE' OR n.origin
     = 'LA' OR n.origin = 'G1') 
AND (n.popularity >= 527 AND n.popularity <= 8200)
AND (n.gender = 'F')
AND (p.gender = 'F')
AND (right(p.pron,locate(' ',reverse(p.pron))-1) != 'AH')
AND (n.syllables = 3)
AND (left(n.name,1) = 'M' OR left(n.name,1) = 'W' OR left(n.name,1) =
    'R' OR left(n.name,1) = 'T' OR left(n.name,1) = 'B' OR
    left(n.name,1) = 'P')"

=>

(0 0 ("life" "Biblical town") "Bethany" "F" "HE" "3" #("100") 
     "B EH TH AH N IY") 
(0 0 ("son of Matthew") "Madison" "F" "EN" "3" #("100") 
     "M AE D IH S AH N")
(0 0 ("happiness" "descendant of Kenneth") "Mackenzie" 
     "F" "G1" "3" #("010") 
     "M AH K IH N Z IY")
(0 0 ("pearl: gemstone") "Margaret" "F" "LA" "3" #("100")
     "M AA R G ER EH T"))

FUTURE WORK:

* Allow beginning/ending/medial sounds to be sequences, not just
  isolates.  For example, I want a name that ends in 'SH AH'; right
  now I can only say "ends in 'AH'" and contains "SH".  Should be
  straightforward to back-end

* Interface to a TTS pronouncer, for interactive (browser) use:
  i.e. pronounce a encoded pron sequence, not just name.  I want it
  TTS based, so that we don't have to record everything and to use it
  to test consistency of phonemic repn. and for future extensions.

* Invert pronunciation ML code to generate new spellings for known
  pronunciations: I want the name 'Katie' but I want a unique
  spelling => 'Kati,Kaeti,Kaytie,Qatie,Caity,Katee,'

* Link in all kinds of proprietary annotation data from BJJMM: soap
  opera names, royal names, in/out, macho/feminissima, etc.
